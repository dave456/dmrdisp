# DMR Display
# Overview
This program drives the nexion displays typically found on DMR/PiStar hotspots. There are a huge number of hotspots for sale, and the open source software used to drive them has to pick a lowest common denominator to its support of those devices.

This app is specicialize to MY DMR device. I needed C code to drive the display, and then I use my own private scripts to call the C app to change the display when needed.

I put it out here in case other folks want to drive their own displays.
